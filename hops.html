    <h2>Hops: Aroma and Bitterness</h2>

    <p>
        Hops are flowers. Specifically, they are green, cone-shaped flowers that contain a substance called Lipulus.
        Lipulus is responsible for the aroma and bitterness we find in beer. 

        My understanding of dry hops is that these hops are added later on in the brewing process. That is all I know so far.
