    <h2>Hops: Aroma and Bitterness</h2>

    <p>
        Hops are strobili that consitiutute the flower of the hop plant (<em>Humulus Lupulus</em>). Specifically, they are green, cone-shaped flowers that contain the essential oils
        and resin that are used by brewers. Additionally, hops <b>inhibit bacterial growth</b>. This natural preservative property is a key reason
        why brewers began using hops in the first place.
        
        <p>
            Resin contains the alpha and beta acids that create the bitterness.
            <br>
            The alpha acids (<em>humulones</em>) go through a process called isomerization, where the configuration of molecules changes, but not the chemical formula. Let's break down this process:
            <ol>
                <li>Hops are boiled in the wort</li>
                <li>Iso-alpha acids (iso-humulones) are created during the isomerization process, which develops bitterness and solubility in the alpha acids. </li>
                <li>The longer the boil, the more alpha acids are isolmerized -> the more bitter the beer will be. ~1 hour = 25-30% of hops are isomerized</li>
            </ol>
             The beta acids (<em>lupulones</em>) are not isomerized, but rather oxidized by storing them for longer periods of time. This is where the term 'aged hops' comes from.
            <br>

            The essential oils create the aroma.
