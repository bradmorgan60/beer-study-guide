        <p>
            What is malt? To put it simply, malt is a grain. The most common grain used in the brewing process is barley. The reason for this is 
            because the barley seed retains its husk after threshing on a farm. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There are 3 steps in the malting process:
            <br>

            <ol>
                <li>Steeping</li>
                <ul>
               <li> This is when the barley seeds are soaked in warm water to begin the germination process </li>
                </ul>
                    <br>
                         
                <li>Germination</li> 

                <ul>
               <li> In this phase, enzymes are activated in the barley seed. The breakdown of the Protein-carbohydrate matrix around the starch reserves occurs.
                 The starch reserves are used in the creation of beer. </li>
                </ul>
                        
                <ul>
                <li> How much has the seed broken down? Maltsters evaluate this by squeezing the seed with their fingers. From this, they can figure out the 
                 degree of modification. That is, how much the protein-carbohydrate matrix has been broken down throughout the kernel. </li>
                </ul>
                    
                <ul>
                <li> Following this, the malt is dried with warm air under carefully controlled conditions. The reason for this is becasue it <strong>preserves the enzymes</strong> that 
                 will later be used to convert those starch reserves into sugar. </li>
                </ul>
                        <br>
        
               <li>Kilning</li> 
                <ul>
               <li> This is when the germinated barley is heated to create the malty, "biscuit-like" flavors.
                   Think of this like baking a pizza. The longer you bake, the darker the grain becomes. This is 
                what creates the flavor and color of your beer.  </li>
                </ul>
            
        </ol>
        </p>
