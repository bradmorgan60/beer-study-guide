    <h2>Welcome to My Beer Study Page!</h2>
<br>
<p>
    The purpose of this project is to document notes and findings from the brewing process. I work at a brewery
    part-time and have continuously grown interested in beer and the brewing process. 
    <br>
</p>

<p>
    I want to organize the pages by what I learn. Eventually, I want to brew my own beer. As always, the goal is to learn.
